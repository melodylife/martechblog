## What is Vision Pro
![Apple Vision Pro](https://d1gqx5wdpmskko.cloudfront.net/posts/vision-pro-on-marketing/vision-pro.jpeg)
  In early June 2023, Apple has launched their new creative AR product which is called vision pro. According to the reaction of the industry , the product is undoubtedly beyond the expectation. On one hand it's because to of the marketing strategy before its launch that Apple tried their best to pull down industry expectation. While on the other hand , vision pro does bring some features which are not predicted by the media worldwide. For the consumers, the vision pro can act as 
   * A new projection device to expand vision border of their existing workspace or entertainment screen. 
   * A new device to provide immersive experience in some particular scenarios, like meditation, exercises , movie watching , gaming , etc. 
   * A new AR/MR for social communication. Users can leverage its design to switch communication between virtual and realistic world , or even mix the two worlds together. 
Above are the major features that we summmarized from the intro session although there are so many details that support them shared by the anual press in June. 
## How can the Vision Pro shock the marketing industry ?
  While most of industry are suprised by the inspired device in the consumer industry, I believe we can achieve more with the device in the marketing area. Although I can't see any possibility that the device can reforge the marketing industry but it'll bring some shock wave. Let's firstly think of what happend when marketing was entering the online marketing era. The major change is not the media or the public focus from paper to web but the way to track the users.
  Why do we say that in the online marketing , we can measure the performance of every pence ? The reason is that behaviors of indivisuals can be tracked in real time on the web. Therefore, measurement of ad has entered a new era. 
### Killer feature brought by Vision Pro into the marketing industry
  As so, the killer feature that brought by vision pro to the marketing industry is the new tracking technology, which is eye tracking. The eye tracking i not new to the market. It's been brought to the sight since beginning of 21st century. About 5-6 years ago, some Ad platforms tried to leverage the technology to detect eye focus of audiences that they can share with brand that how their advertisement can attract audience focus. 
  This is genius but without possibility to operate. Firstly, the terminal like PC or mobile hardwares are not ready. Cameras should be the part such solution fully reply on. Secondly, due to the privacy protection, most of the audiences don't allow Ad platforms to call their camera to detect their focus. However, situation is different in AR/VR headset. The eye tracking parts is mandatory to be switched on.Moreover, the focus tracking is highly unified with user experience. 
  Hence, the good news is this function is always on. The marketers can ask for permission to use the statistic data for measure the eye-catching performance of Ad.  
  Eye-focus will become one sub-layer of the marketing funnel. It will play a major role in the customer journey. It will help marketers detect audience intention of the presented marketing content and optimize the assets from the very beginning of the marketing process. 
## How to get prepared ? 
###  What are the difficulties ? 
  Although, it's so exciting that tracking will evolve considerably in the VR/AR headset, there is still long way to go before it'll grow to a reasonable scale to get recognition of the industry. The privacy protection is the top barrier of this feature. Although statistical data won't leak any privacy, audience are used to avoid any app to track. But since eye tracking will become a must-be-on feature in the VR/AR headset like vision pro, we can hope Apple make this feature similar to location, photo album or contact list to ask for permission from users. In that case there will be some signals tracked that can be used for analyze. Let's  keep finger crossed.  
### What to do next ? 
  Since Apple Vision Pro will be available to consumer market in 2024, there will be some update of the device before it's launching. We should keep on checking for any changes of all the similar devices provided by Apple, Meta or some other competitors in the market. Secondly, as what we discussed in previous articles, we need to try to create transactions in the VR/AR market. Only the transaction can stimulate the Advertisment. Anyways, all the advertisers are marketing with the expect to earn more from the audiences.
