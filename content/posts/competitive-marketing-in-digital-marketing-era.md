# Typical case for competitive marketing
When you are about to buy a mobile phone, which brand jumps out first in your mind? Apple iPhone is undoutedly the one leading the option list in the market. But what are the alternatives ? If you don't have enough budget or you need an Android for a particular purpose, which brand are you thinking of right away when you are composing the list  ? 
Years ago, Huawei was always marketing with the slogon "To overcome Apple in the industry". You would think of Huawei phone unconciously when you are reviewing the configuration of iPhone. How about now ? 
Maybe you've already paid attention to Xiaomi in recent years. Xiaomi CEO Jun Lei has been saying that Xiaomi will fully model itself on Apple. It'll produce mobile phones with same or superior experience than iPhone. 
Is that possible ? We can't conclude yet. However, by comparing earning report of two companies, the spending on
development , gap of talents and supply chain controlling can't give out any optimistic prediction for Xiaomi yet. Why do they keep on marketing with something they can't make it for a while  ? 
# Why does enterprise need to do competive marketing  ?
If such enterprise don't think they can overtake the marketshare from Apple, why does Huawei and Xiaomi are always trying to bundle their brand recogniztion with Apple ? 
The purpose is not to convince customers that they can be the better choice than Apple in one day, however, the reason is that they hope to absorb as many users from the user group they are targeting. Android phone manufaturers are targeting the audience group who are willing to buy iPhone but with some particular reasons that they can't. In that case, the second place in
the list is quite important. The one who sits after Apple in the list will absorb the most of the users falling from the first layer of the funnel.
